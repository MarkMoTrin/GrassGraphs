% Function:    graphLaplacian_Clean
% Description: This function constructs an epsilon graph for a particular
%              epsilon and then computes the graph Laplacian of this graph.
%              The graph Laplacian can either be a weighted graph or a
%              simple adjacency computations. The weighted graphs can be
%              either a heat kernel weighting or just the Euclidean
%              distance weights. 
% 
% Inputs: 
%
%   data            - Can be any NxD data matrix, for this framework we 
%                     form the graph on the U eigenvectors from the SVD 
%                     decomposition of the affine representation of the 
%                     shape.  
%
%   p.epsilon       - Epsilon for epsilon neighborhood graph. 
%
%   p.graphType     - Flag for the type of graph to construct. 
%                     'eucDist' - Euclidean distances as the weights. 
%                     'heatKer' - Heat kernel weights. 
%                     'connect' - Just the connectivity graph using the
%                                 adjacency matrix. 
%
%   p.hkt            - Value for the heat kernel. 
%
% Outputs.
%
%   L                - Graph Laplacian.
% 
% Usage: Used in the affine invariance framework.
